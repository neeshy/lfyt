This project is loosely based on https://github.com/slavistan/lf-gadgets/tree/master/lf-yt

These scripts allow you to search for YouTube videos and select which video to
watch using lf.

Differences with lf-gadgets/lf-yt
  * youtube-dl is used instead of requiring a YouTube API key. This makes
    searching much slower.
  * Multiple files can be played at once using the file selection
